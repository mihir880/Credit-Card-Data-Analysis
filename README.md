# Credit-Card-Data-Analysis
I am trying to analyze whether there is any space for new players in the credit card industry. To determine this, I did data cleaning and analysis on a dataset which shows user credit card spending in India.

The credit card industry in India has seen significant growth in recent years, with a surge in the number of users and transactions. A dataset from Kaggle was utilized for data analysis, initially deemed clean without requiring additional cleaning. However, modifications were made for analytical purposes, such as converting the date column from string to datetime format and splitting the city column into city and country components for enhanced analysis depth.

During the analysis, challenges were encountered in determining the most effective visualization charts to elucidate the data due to the multitude of factors influencing the credit card industry in India. Selecting appropriate visualization techniques was crucial for effectively communicating insights from the dataset.
